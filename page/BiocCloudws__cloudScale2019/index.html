<h1>Cloud-scale genomic data science with Bioconductor</h1>
<div id="abstract" class="section level2">
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Bioconductor’s approach to the analysis of genome-scale assays is
rooted in commitments to the use of self-describing data objects
representing genomic assays and annotation. Analysis tools and workflows
based on these objects have proven effective in a large
number of scientific projects and publications.</p>
<p>The dominant model for utilization of Bioconductor to date
involves a locally controlled deployment of R and
Bioconductor/CRAN packages in an essentially closed
storage and execution environment.</p>
<p>New approaches to federated
elastic computing with lab-resident or commercial cloud
environments provide opportunities for inference on questions
of vast scope. This workshop is devoted to understanding how
to leverage Bioconductor’s strengths
in seizing these new opportunities. Special attention is devoted
to how
programming and reporting
patterns familiar from two decades of Bioconductor development
and use can be retained, or must change, in cloud-scale genomic
data science.</p>
<p>Our approach will be a mix of lecture and hands-on programming
with Rstudio Cloud. We will learn how the restfulSE and BiocOncoTK
packages work with HDF Scalable Data Service and Google BigQuery
to provide immediate interactive access to a compendium of 181000
human transcriptomics experiments, and to the PanCancer Atlas.
We will also learn how to couple Docker containers with formal
workflows in CWL and WDL to achieve sharable reproducible analyses
with nearly zero configuration.</p>

<div id="pre-requisites" class="section level2">
<h2>Pre-requisites</h2>
<ul>
<li>Basic knowledge of R syntax</li>
<li>Familiarity with the SummarizedExperiment class</li>

<li>Familiarity with docker containers is not required but a running docker installation will be useful</li>
</ul>

<h2>Workshop goals and objectives</h2>
<p>Goals:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Develop an appreciation of strengths and limitations
of Bioconductor’s approach
to structure and annotation of genome-scale data as scope
of data grows to cloud scale</p></li>
<li><p>Learn about alternatives to “all-in-memory” models of
computing in R, and how Bioconductor has used such alternatives
in the local computing model
(e.g., external SQLite databases, local HDF5 serialization,
API to remote services)</p></li>
<li><p>Obtain experience using Bioconductor
methods and tools with data and annotation that are cloud-scale</p></li>
<li><p>Develop an appreciation of threats to reliability and predictable
costs that arise when working with commercial cloud computing</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Objectives:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Use rhdf5client to interact with matrix data in HDF Scalable Data Service</p></li>
<li><p>Use BiocOncoTK to interrogate multiomic PanCancer atlas data in Google BigQuery</p></li>
<li><p>Understand the role of Docker containers and formal workflow
expression in establishing reproducible and shareable large
scale analyses</p></li>

<div id="delayedarray-concepts-5min" class="section level2">
<h2>DelayedArray concepts (5min)</h2>
<p>Our interest in cloud-scale computing methods
arises in part from desire to analyze very large
data sets with computers that have relatively small
endowments of random access memory. The most common
methods of working with R assume that all data are
resident in memory and can be addressed directly.</p>
<div id="acquisition-of-breast-cancer-rna-seq-data-from-tcga" class="section level3">
<h3>Acquisition of breast cancer RNA-seq data from TCGA</h3>
<p>In this section we will construct two representations of
RNA-seq data for breast cancer tumors collected in TCGA.
First we use <code>curatedTCGAData</code> to obtain a standard in-memory
representation in a SummarizedExperiment.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(curatedTCGAData)
brMAE = curatedTCGAData(&quot;BRCA&quot;, &quot;RNASeq2GeneNorm&quot;, dry.run=FALSE)</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>brexp = experiments(brMAE)[[1]] # should use name
colnames(brexp) = substr(colnames(brexp),1,12) # need to shorten
cd = colData(brMAE)[colnames(brexp),]
colData(brexp) = cd
brexp</code></pre>
<pre><code>## class: SummarizedExperiment 
## dim: 20501 1212 
## metadata(0):
## assays(1): ''
## rownames(20501): A1BG A1CF ... psiTPTE22 tAKR
## rowData names(0):
## colnames(1212): TCGA-3C-AAAU TCGA-3C-AALI ... TCGA-Z7-A8R5
##   TCGA-Z7-A8R6
## colData names(2684): patientID years_to_birth ...
##   Integrated.Clusters..unsup.exp.
##   X60.Gene.classifier.Class.Assignment</code></pre>
<p>We estimate its size in RAM.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(SummarizedExperiment) # assay
object.size(assay(brexp))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 200190840 bytes</code></pre>
<p>This is not particularly large, but in certain applications
it is advantageous to have tight control
over the memory consumption required for an analysis. In
this form we have no choice – either the complete dataset
is in memory or it is not and cannot be accessed without
loading it in its entirety.</p>
</div>
<div id="exporting-the-expression-data-to-hdf5" class="section level3">
<h3>Exporting the expression data to HDF5</h3>
<p>Now we develop a representation on disk. We use
the HDF5 data format as it is well-established as
a tool for managing numerical data in
scientific computing.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(HDF5Array)
saveHDF5SummarizedExperiment(brexp, &quot;brexpHDF5&quot;, replace=TRUE)</code></pre>
<p>We named the HDF5 repository for the data <code>brexpHDF5</code>; this
is in fact a folder created in the current working directory.
Its contents are a SummarizedExperiment ‘shell’ in RDS format,
and the HDF5 matrix representation of the RNA-seq quantifications.</p>

<div id="using-the-on-disk-hdf5-representation" class="section level3">
<h3>Using the on-disk HDF5 representation</h3>
<p>We use a loading function to retrieve the
new SummarizedExperiment instance. Its
memory consumption is independent of the
dimensions of the assay matrix.</p>

<h2>Exercises with the HumanTranscriptomeCompendium and the HDF Scalable Data Service (10min)</h2>
<p>The HumanTranscriptomeCompendium package was formed to take
advantage of two new technologies.</p>
<p>The first is the
<a href="https://omicidx-test.cancerdatasci.org/docs">OmicIDX</a>
metadata transformation and access facility, devised
by Dr Sean Davis of NCI.
This currently provides comprehensive access to metadata
about sequencing studies collected at NCBI SRA, but will
be extended to other institutional metadata archives.</p>
<p>The second is HDF Scalable Data Service, devised by
John Readey of The HDF Group. Substantial support has been
provided to Bioconductor by HDF Group, with open hosting
of significant genomic data archives in a publicly accessible
server.</p>
<p>Fruits of both of these developments are used in the following
exercises.</p>

<h3>The ca43k app</h3>
<p>We have a shiny app that mediates access to cancer-related studies in the
compendium. Using the following command starts the app. Clear
the initial tabs and cart elements. Search for the
string ‘lncRNAs’ and then search the resulting table for ‘archived’.
Then stop the app.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>cadat = ca43k()</code></pre>
<p>Now <code>metadata(cadat)[[2]]</code> is a data.frame that gives sample-level
metadata on the samples that were retrieved. How many different
tissues were assayed?</p>
<p>Have a look at the paper referenced in the associated PMID.
Find the lncRNA that the authors assert is specific to breast
and display its distribution of abundance across tissues.</p>

<h3>Comparing methylation levels between tumor and matched normal tissues at a specific CpG probe</h3>
<p>In PMID 29540343 it is noted that increased methylation at
CpG probe cg22748573 (within exon 1 of CITED4)
is associated with decreased risk
of bladder cancer. We’ll use tumor-normal pairs to
check for differential methylation in tumor tissue at
this site.</p>

<h2>Docker and CWL/WDL with Dockstore.org (10min)</h2>
<p>dockstore.org implements a GA4GH concept of reproducible
research by connecting a CWL/WDL workflow program to a
docker container that is endowed with everything needed
to execute the workflow.</p>
<p>An example workflow is available, that [annotates variants
observed in a given Coriell cell line sample]
