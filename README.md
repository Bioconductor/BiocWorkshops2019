## For Everyone

This book contains workshops used in _R_ / _Bioconductor_
training. The workshops are divided into 3 sections:

- **Learn** (100-series chapters) contains material for beginning
  users of _R_ and _Bioconductor_. The _Bioconductor_-related material
  is relevant even for experienced _R_ users who are new to
  _Bioconductor_.

- **Use** (200-series chapters) contains workshops emphasizing use of
  _Bioconductor_ for common tasks, e.g., bulk RNA-seq differential
  expression, ChIP-seq, single-cell analysis, gene set enrichment, and
  annotation.

- **Develop** (500-series chapters) contains workshops to help expert
  users hone their skills and contribute their domain-specific
  knowledge to the _Bioconductor_ community.

## For Workshop Authors

To contribute a new workshop, open a [BiocWorkshops issue][] starting with
the `[Workshop]` keyword in the title of the issue. Provide a link to the
repository in the issue message body. You may also include GitHub usernames
of workshop collaborators. For a successful workshop build, adhere to the
following:

1. Package your workshop as an R package
2. Include a standard vignette in the vignettes directory
3. Put any extra files (images, .bib) in `inst/vignettes` and reference them
in the vignette using `system.file`
4. Number **3** requires package chapter installation before vignette build or
`build_vignettes=TRUE` when building the package.

### DESCRIPTION

Update the DESCRIPTION file adding packages utilized in your workshop to
the **Imports** field.

### Classifying your workshop

Follow the numbering scheme above to classify your workshop by preceding your title with
"Bioconductor 1xx:", "Bioconductor 2xx:", or "Bioconductor 5xx:". Final workshop numbers will be
determined by an editor.
